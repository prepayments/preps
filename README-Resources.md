# RESOURCES

Most of the spring resources are generated by spring, however to facilitate quick iteration and changes
over the source, the jhipster-generated resources are treated as components to be used in implementing
some resource interface in a decorator.

For instance the following is a decorator for the amortization-update-resource

# Data Uploads

In general batch data update is expected to be carried out by excel files uploaded through decorated controllers.
The file once persisted is tokenized and a notification is sent through out pertaining to its existence and form
through a non-synchronous queue.
The notification on receipt will trigger the deserializer to read the population of the file and the data stream so produce
is channeled once again into the queue.
The listener for the data stream queue will then carry out persistence of the data received into the respective repository.
The complicated nature of this upload process ensures that the front-end client can receive a quick response on uploading
a file, without having to await a length file deserialization and reading process.
While server response does not guarantee success of data acquisition it does allow once to see file tokens with which new data
will be associated to the file, meaning that erroneous data could be deleted by simply removing the new file.
It also ensures that the system can take advance of parallel processing and maximize processor capacity utlization.
